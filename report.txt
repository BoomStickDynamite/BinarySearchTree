Assignment 2
AD 325

I started the assignment too late.  I worked on the add method first and didn't finish.
Everything doesn't work.  I didn't even test it.  I would use the print sideways
function from the Java programming book.  Motivation is my biggest problem right now.
I learned that I need to start on the work the night that we get it and figure out some 
motivation.  I would immediately set up a test environment so I could see my progress.

I'll send you an email about my issues as well.
